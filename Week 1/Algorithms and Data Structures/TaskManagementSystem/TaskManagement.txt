1)Explain the different types of linked lists (Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List).
Ans: Singly Linked List:
         Each node contains data and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence.
         Traversal takes only in one direction.

    Doubly Linked List:
         Each node contains data, a reference to the next node, and a reference to the previous node.
         Allows traversal in both directions (forward and backward).

2)Analyze the time complexity of each operation.
Ans: Add:
O(1) - Adding at the beginning of the list.
Search:
O(n) - In the worst case, if the task is at the end of the list or not present.
Traverse:
O(n) - Visiting each node once.
Delete:
Best-case: O(1) - If the task is at the beginning of the list.
Worst-case: O(n) - If the task is at the end of the list or not present.
