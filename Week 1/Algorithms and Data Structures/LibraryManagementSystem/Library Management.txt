1)Explain linear search and binary search algorithms.
Ans: Linear Search:

Description: A straightforward search algorithm that checks each element in a list one by one until the desired element is found or the list ends.
Best Use Case: Suitable for small or unsorted data sets.
Binary Search:

Description: An efficient search algorithm that repeatedly divides a sorted list in half to find the desired element
Best Use Case: Suitable for large, sorted data sets.

2)Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search.
Ans: Linear Search:
Worst-case: O(n)
Best-case: O(1) if the desired element is the first one.
Average-case: O(n)

Binary Search:
Worst-case: O(log n)
Best-case: O(1) if the desired element is the middle one.
Average-case: O(log n)
